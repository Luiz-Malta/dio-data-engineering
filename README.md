# dio-data-engineering
<p>Hi people of the Internet! This is my 1st repository. I'm not gonna lie, I was scared about this. I'm programming for some time now, but I'm aways ashamed to put myself out there. I'm working with Data for about 3 years now, mostly on analysis, but I'm aiming a work as a Data Scientist, and I study a lot for this.</p>
<p>For now, in the company I'm working for, the I.T manager, in a colab with my boss (the Operational Excellency manager) wants to start a Data Engineering process, and lucky me, I'm gonna be the Data Engineer lol. So, I'm doing a Data Engineering Bootcamp in a plataform that's pretty cool, it's called DIO (Digital Inovation One) a brazillian site that offers a lot of free knowledge in many technology areas. This repository is where I'm going to put the Bootcamp projects and exercises. Also, it's gonna help me with my fear to share my work with others, something that's been holding me back for a while now.</p>
<p>So... let's get to the point! I'm gonna edit this as I'm advancing in the bootcamp, but for now you can find here:</p>
